# Admin tools

A set of tools made for the administration of the /tg/ SS13 codebase. Hopefully more tools to come.

Made for Python 3.9.7

## For all admins

- `centcom_query` for querying the global ban database

## For admin trainers

- `trainer_suite.py` combines slur detection with automatic log downloading
- `candy_stalker.py` automatically gets soemone's round say logs, works only on /tg/station13, as it uses Scrubby and public logs
- `slur_detector.py` scans some text and determines if any specified slurs are present
