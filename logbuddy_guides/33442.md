# [Rageguy505] Noted over a firelock crush on LRP (1984? literally?)

[Appeal link](https://tgstation13.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=33442)

**NOTE**: if you don't know what a command does, add `?` in front or back to find out. Example: `?%dl`

In this appeal Rider Meza apparently wordlessly crushed someone with a firelock. Let's download the round logs and see what happened

```py
%dl 200316
```

To download raw logs, type `y` and enter when asked. The command will download logs from the servers, and store them in a file named `200316.log`. If you quit and want to resume without downloading the logs again, type `%load_logs 200316.log`.

Let's try seeing Reider's interactions in this round

```py
%heard Maskenary
%l
```

`l` stands for `length`.

**NOTE**: you don't need to prefix everything with `%`. Try `dl`

Let's see what happened in the first 100 logs

```py
%head 100
```

To print out everything, use `p` or `print_logs`

```py
%p
```

It's always smart to use `l` before `p`, as sometimes we have tens of thousands of logs. As you can imagine, that won't help us much. Let's try seeing what was up with those firelocks

```py
%string firelock
%p
```

Quick sidenote: if you see something that isn't correctly highlighted, please open a [bug report](https://github.com/RigglePrime/SS13-tools/issues/new/choose)! (this specific one has been already fixed)

Let's reset the logs and isolate these two

```py
%reset
%ckey iwishforducks maskenary
%p
```

**NOTE**: you don't need to prefix everything with `%`. Try `dl`

It's recommended to clear your screen with `%cls` before every `%p` so you don't get confused

If we scroll a bit we can see Reider attacking Bugger with no prior interaction:

Feel free to make your window larger! I kept it relatively small so the image appears larger.

Reider wasn't lying in the appeal, he threw the suture after firelocking Bugger. What else has Reider been up to? Let's undo that last step, and find out.

```py
%undo
%heard Maskenary
%p
```

**NOTE**: if there's too many logs a pager will activate Press enter to or space to advance a screen, and q to quit. You may try `%head` or `%tail` instead. (you can run both commands with a number, to change the amount printed: `%head 50`)

This prints out quite a lot of logs! Everything is neatly coloured, but maybe you want to want to read the logs elsewhere, like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code. To do that we could either save this to a file with `%s` or `%s filename here`, or `%clip` and copy everything in the filter to the clipboard.

To make this slightly easier, let's clear our screen and limit the logs to say and attack only. (alternatively just exclude telecomms with `%type !TCOMMS`). Remember that you can also always filter logs by ckey is `%heard` outputs too many!

```py
%cls
%type SAY ATTACK
```

This is where the useful commands end and exploration begins

Random violence...

More violence with 0 say logs

Really seems like Reider is just shoving random people constantly

From this point on it's just more pointless shoving, the short king of medbay part, and breaking into the AI chamber with hulk and an esword.
