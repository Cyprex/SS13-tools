[Sightld2] Bob Calistan - Appealing perma ban as psychcologist
https://tgstation13.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=32153

## The Appeal
When we first look at an appeal, we need to extract the most important information: Who, Where, and When.

### Who:  
The appeal specifies a number of people:
- Filicondris Aggley (Bob Calistan), the appealer
- Decker Buzzard
- An engineer
- The detective
- A bartender
- A chemist

Checking the [manifest logs](https://tgstation13.org/parsed-logs/basil/data/logs/2022/07/25/round-187237/manifest.txt) for that round, we can infer who the unnamed people in the appeal are. Thankfully there aren't that many people, so that makes our job easier.

```
[2022-07-25 03:57:40.515] ggtedi \ Ted Ei \ Chemist \ NONE \ ROUNDSTART
[2022-07-25 03:57:43.576] tjacks \ Smoke Jackson \ Station Engineer \ Thief \ ROUNDSTART
[2022-07-25 03:58:11.329] Outlaw_7 \ Jayquon Tavius \ Bartender \ NONE \ LATEJOIN
[2022-07-25 04:00:13.600] Thaumic \ Dallas Treeby \ Detective \ NONE \ LATEJOIN
```

### Where
- Hallway outside of medical
- The armory
- The bar

### When
In the appeal, the events are laid out: 
1. Decker Buzzard is attacking people outside of medbay
2. Filicondris Aggley expresses their concern at the assault. 
3. Filicondris Aggley meets up with the chemist (Ted Ei) and a bartender (Jayquon Tavius)
4. The four of them beat the detective (Dallas Treeby) to death
5. Filicondris Aggley follows an engineer (Smoke Jackson) into the armory
6. Filicondris Aggley steals a laser gun from the armory
7. The other 3 kill everyone in the bar area, Filicondris Aggley does not participate
8. Filicondris Aggley and the others kill Decker Buzzard


## The Parsing
The first thing we have to is get the logs for this round. The raw logs aren't necessary for this investigation, since we're just looking at regular player actions.
```
%dl 187237
```

We don't need the access logs (we're just looking at the in-game round actions) so we can exclude them from our output.
```
%type !ACCESS
```

### Getting Familiar with the Tool
Let's warm up by looking for the incident Filicondris was referring to. They've helpfully given what looks like a direct quote in their appeal: ``I did mention to one of the guys in medical that it seemed like they were just letting "very bad people" roam around``
```
%string 'very bad people'
```

Use ``%p`` to print and... bingo!
```
[2022-07-25 04:33:44.063] SAY: Bob Calistan/(Filicondris Aggley) "i was told there was very bad people" (Medbay Aft (152,114,4))
```
 
 ``%undo`` once to remove the last filter; we've already got the data we need. Now we can filter by location.

 ```
 %location "Medbay Aft"
 ```

There are only 25 results left (you can see how many with ``%l``), so we can use ``%p`` again to see the logs taking place only in Medbay Aft.
```
...
[2022-07-25 04:24:09.417] ATTACK: Bob Calistan/(Filicondris Aggley) has transferred reagents (/datum/reagent/toxin/chloralhydrate (15u, 0.473542 purity)) from the syringe to [syringe] (Medbay Aft (153,108,4))
[2022-07-25 04:24:09.418] ATTACK: Bob Calistan/(Filicondris Aggley) has fired at SomeguyThatisnotaguy/(Decker Buzzard) with the syringe from Medbay Aft (NEWHP: 47.9)  (Medbay Aft (153,108,4))
[2022-07-25 04:24:09.419] ATTACK: Bob Calistan/(Filicondris Aggley) has shot GG-Tedi/(Ted Ei) with the syringe  REAGENTS:Chloral Hydrate (15) (NEWHP: 40.5)  (Medbay Aft (153,108,4))
...
```
The above might sound familiar- it was mentioned in the appeal!
>I think I may have accidentally hit a doctor with a syringe of chloral hydrate from the syringe gun while attempting to pacify Decker earlier in the round, but this was purely accidental

This isn't what we're looking for, and there isn't much else here that we need, so we can ``%undo`` again.

### Investigation Start
Our investigation is only related to things that happen around the appealer, so we can eliminate all the logs from the rest of the station.
```
%heard bobcalistan
```

Filtering by the ckeys of the other participants
```
%ckey someguythatisnotaguy ggtedi tjacks outlaw_7 thaumic
```
brings us from 930 logs down to 394. From here it's a lot easier to look through the logs manually.


Here we can confirm that Filicondris and Smoke were actively beating Dallas, while Jayquon and Ted Ei were standing by.

```

It looks like our appealer was being truthful-- besides the detective that they killed, the only person they appeared to attack intentionally was Decker Buzzard. It was their compatriots who attacked the other diner patrons! 

When responding to an appeal with logs, there are some [rules](https://tgstation13.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=4876) you have to follow. The most important rules are: 
1. The contents of the line must be unmodified (you shouldn't be removing things that don't fit your narrative of the events!) If you need to cut out unecessary lines or post lines just related to one person, disclose that somewhere.
2. You need to link the source file that you got the logs from so that others can look at the logs for themselves. Even if you only quoted one line!
